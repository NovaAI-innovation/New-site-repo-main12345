# BMAD Quick Flow Standards

## 1. The Quick Flow Exception
- **Definition:** "Quick Flow" is a permitted exception to the standard `001-bmad-workflow` phases.
- **Agent:** `quick-flow-solo-dev` (Barry).
- **Scope:** Small features, bug fixes, prototypes, or "spikes".
- **Bypass:** Skips PRD, Architecture, and Epics phases.

## 2. Quick Flow Artifacts
Instead of heavy planning docs, Quick Flow relies on:
- **Tech Spec:** A lightweight `tech-spec.md` (or similar) that combines requirements and implementation plan.
- **WIP File:** Maintains a `tech-spec-wip.md` during active development.

## 3. Quick Flow Operating Rules
- **No Bureaucracy:** Do not ask for user personas or market research unless explicitly requested.
- **Code First:** Prioritize getting to code. "Specs are for building, not bureaucracy."
- **Self-Contained:** The agent handles the full lifecycle (Spec -> Code -> Test) autonomously.

## 4. Transitioning to Standard Flow
- **Escalation:** If a Quick Flow task grows too large (>1 week effort or touches >5 major systems), recommend transitioning to the Standard Method (Workflow Init).
- **Artifact Handover:** The `tech-spec.md` serves as the seed for a future `PRD` or `Architecture` doc if the project upgrades.

## 5. Execution Steps
1. **Understand:** Analyze requirement delta.
2. **Investigate:** Map technical constraints (read code first).
3. **Spec:** Generate a lean implementation plan (files, tasks, AC).
4. **Execute:** Red-Green-Refactor loop.
5. **Verify:** Self-correction and test validation.
