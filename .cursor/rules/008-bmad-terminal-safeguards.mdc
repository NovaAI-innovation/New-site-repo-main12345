# BMAD Terminal Safeguards

## 1. No Terminal Chat (CRITICAL)
- **Rule:** NEVER use terminal tools (e.g., `run_shell_command`) to send plain English messages or conversational text to the user.
- **Forbidden:** No `echo "Hello User"`, `echo "Step 1 complete"`, or entering plain text into the shell input.
- **Interface Separation:** All natural language communication, status updates, and facilitation dialogue MUST happen through the standard Chat/LLM response interface.

## 2. Executable Only
- **Rule:** The terminal is strictly reserved for valid, executable system commands (PowerShell).
- **Validation:** Before running a command, verify it is a functional instruction (e.g., `git status`, `npm test`, `mkdir`). 
- **No Filler:** Do not use `echo` to "log" progress within a command string unless it is part of a script's functional output.

## 3. Tool usage discipline
- **One Sentence Rule:** Per system instructions, provide exactly one short, concise natural language sentence in the chat before calling a terminal tool.
- **Silence:** Do not use the terminal to "think out loud."

## 4. Error Handling
- **Non-Interactive:** Prefer non-interactive flags (e.g., `-y`, `--force`) to prevent the shell from hanging.
- **Redirection:** If a command is expected to be verbose, redirect output to a temp file as per standard guidelines instead of flooding the terminal with text.
